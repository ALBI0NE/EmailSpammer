# EmailSpammer
 Emailspammer made to spam your email!
 
Before running the program I recommend creating a new email address, *for now emailSpammer only supports gmail*!
To create a new email head to:
• https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&hl=en&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp
Fill up all the information and then go to: 
• https://myaccount.google.com/security?pli=1
Here you create a 2-Step Verification so the account will be able to generate a password which will be used to login with a bot, *otherwise it will not work*!
If you have created a 2-Step Verification you should be able to see App Passowprd under 2-Step Verification

Select App Password 

From the drop menu called "Select app" choose Mail
And from Select Device choose "Windows computer"
Click Generate
You should be able to see an APP password that you will use in when logging to a server (first setup)

ENJOY SPAMMING YOUR EMAIL!
